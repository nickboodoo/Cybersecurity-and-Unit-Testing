This is a repository for a class. 

These are various assignments which required us to do the following:
    Identify vulnerabilites in programs,
    research the vulnerability,
    fix the vulnerability, and
    identify what sort of data could have been compromised due to the vulnerability.


We also did some unit testing for some of the assignments.
